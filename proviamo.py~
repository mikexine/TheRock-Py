## this is just an example. if you want to run it, you need to insert
## your username, password and API key (if you don't have one you can
## contact therocktrading.com and ask them for your key)
##
## Note that MarketData, LastTrades and GetBalance functions do NOT
## require an API KEY.
##
## I put a sleep(1) between each query because trt has a request limit
## which is five API calls per second - it's a bit slower but for this
## example it is ok.
##
## You should have a look on the code before putting in it your account
## data and running it. This one creates also some orders, so you might
## check them before they are created. Also, there might be some bug or
## error, so use this with caution.
##
## Do whatever you want with this code - but keep in mind that I do NOT
## take any responsibility for errors or losses caused by this script.
