#TheRock-Py

This script gets data from the [The Rock Trading Ltd Exchange](https://www.therocktrading.com/referral/80). For some of the request you don't need to be registered on the exchange. 
Have a look at the Examples folder. *try3.py* is just an example script; more description is inside the file, you should have a look at it. 
If you want, you can get data from all the markets on TRT, just change the try3.py file. 

If you need an API key you can generate one under your "Personal Settings" page on the exchange. 

To run TheRock-Py you need to check if you have installed the `requests`library. If you're missing it, just run `pip install requests` or `pip3 install requests`.

###April 2015:

I switched to Python 3.x. As of today, TheRock-Py has exactly the same features for both Python2.x and Python3.x, but I am planning to keep updated only the version for Python3.x.
