<h1>TheRock-Py</h1>
</div>
This script gets some data from the [The Rock Trading Ltd Exchange](https://www.therocktrading.com/referral/80). For some of the request you don't need to be registered on the exchange. 

- The `example.py` script is just to show how this code works. 
- `PyRock.py` can work with both Python2.x and Python3.x.
- If you need an API key you can generate one under your "My Personal Data --> Apikeys" page on the exchange. 
- When you create a new API Key, you can choose if this key can have read-only access, read and trade access or read, trade and withdraw access. 
- To run TheRock-Py you need to check if you have installed the `requests` library. If you're missing it, just run `pip install requests` or `pip3 install requests`.

####July 2015:
The Rock Trading updated completely its API. Now they are available at the following links: 
- Old "www" API: still available, but deprecated.
- v0 API: available, [click here](api.therocktrading.com/doc/v0/). You should use v1 API.
- v1 API: available, [click here](api.therocktrading.com/doc/v1/). You should try to use this API, but be careful: some minor changes may occur, check [this link](https://www.therocktrading.com/en/topics/working-on-new-api) on the official forum. 
- In the v1 folder you can find a file called "example_pagination.py": this one shows how to get the whole history of the trades of a currency pair. Be careful: if you run it, you might be blacklisted due to the API calls limits (5 requests per second)

####June 2015:
I published a single version of PyRock that should work without bugs with both Python2.x and Python3.x. 
####April 2015:
I switched to Python 3.x. As of today, TheRock-Py has exactly the same features for both Python2.x and Python3.x, but I am planning to keep updated only the version for Python3.x.
