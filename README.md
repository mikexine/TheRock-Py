The Rock Trading Exchange & Python

This is far from complete. As soon as I can, I'll add the Trading API part. 
The try.py is just an example script; it gets the BTC/EUR market data, some of the last EUR/DOGE trades and the BTC/USD orderbook. 
If you want, is possible to get data from all the markets on TRT, just change the try.py files. 

Be careful, it may have some issues. Do whatever you want with code; I am NOT responsible for how you use this.
