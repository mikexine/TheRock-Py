**[The Rock Trading Exchange](https://www.therocktrading.com/referral/80) APIs & Python**

This script gets data from the [The Rock Trading Ltd API](https://www.therocktrading.com/en/pages/api). For some of the request you don't need to be registered on the exchange. 
The try.py is just an example script; more description is inside the file, you should have a look at it. 
If you want, you can get data from all the markets on TRT, just change the try.py file. 

Be careful, it may have some issues. Do whatever you want with code; I am NOT responsible for how you use this.

If you have any suggestions or feedbacks feel free to let me know. 

If you need an API key you can generate one under your "Personal Settings" page on the exchange. 

*April 2015:*
Added .py files for Python 3.x. I used the built-in 2to3 converter. Hope everything works correctly!
