</div>
This script gets some data from the [The Rock Trading Ltd Exchange](https://www.therocktrading.com/referral/80). For some of the request you don't need to be registered on the exchange. 

- The `example.py` script is just to show how this code works. 
- `PyRock.py` can work with both Python2.x and Python3.x.
- If you need an API key you can generate one under your "Personal Settings" page on the exchange. 
- To run TheRock-Py you need to check if you have installed the `requests` library. If you're missing it, just run `pip install requests` or `pip3 install requests`.

####June 2015:
I published a single version of PyRock that should work without bugs with both Python2.x and Python3.x. 
####April 2015:
I switched to Python 3.x. As of today, TheRock-Py has exactly the same features for both Python2.x and Python3.x, but I am planning to keep updated only the version for Python3.x.
